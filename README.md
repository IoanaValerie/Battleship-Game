# Battleship-game
I have implemented the Battleship game. The game is played on four matrices(10x10), two for each player 
and the individual squares in the matrix are identified by letter and number. On one matrix the player 
arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other matrix, the player records their own shots. 
Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary matrix. Each ship occupies a number 
of consecutive squares on the matrix, arranged either horizontally or vertically. After the ships have been positioned, 
the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the 
opponent's matrix which is to be shot at. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
